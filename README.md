# 🔍 URL Security Scanner & Phishing Detection Tool

> ⚠ Educational Use Only
>
> This tool performs client-side URL analysis inside the browser. No URLs are submitted to external services, databases, or third-party APIs.

An interactive React-based cybersecurity tool that analyzes URLs for common phishing indicators, suspicious domains, typosquatting attempts, URL obfuscation techniques, and social engineering patterns.

The scanner uses a heuristic-based detection engine to identify potentially malicious URLs and explain why they may be dangerous.

---

# 📖 Overview

Cybercriminals frequently use deceptive URLs to trick users into visiting phishing websites, downloading malware, or revealing sensitive information.

This project demonstrates how URL analysis techniques can be used to identify common phishing indicators and suspicious patterns before a user visits a website.

The scanner evaluates URLs using multiple security checks and generates a risk score along with detailed explanations for each detected issue.

# 🚩 Detection Techniques

| Detection | Description |
|------------|------------|
| Suspicious TLDs | Common phishing domains such as .xyz, .tk, .pw, .top |
| Typosquatting | Misspelled versions of trusted brands |
| Brand Impersonation | Legitimate brand names hidden inside subdomains |
| Homograph Attacks | Lookalike characters used to mimic trusted domains |
| Excessive Subdomains | Long deceptive domain structures |
| URL Encoding Abuse | Encoded URLs used to hide malicious content |
| Suspicious Keywords | Login, verify, update, account, secure, banking, etc. |
| IP Address URLs | Direct IP usage instead of domain names |
| Redirect Chains | Embedded redirect URLs |
| Entropy Analysis | Machine-generated or random-looking domains |
| Non-Standard Ports | Unusual ports often associated with malicious services |
