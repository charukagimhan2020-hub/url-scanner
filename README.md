# 🔍 URL Security Scanner & Phishing Detection Tool

> ⚠ Educational Use Only
>
> All analysis runs entirely inside the browser. No URLs are submitted to external services, databases, or third-party APIs.

A React-based cybersecurity tool that analyzes URLs for phishing indicators, typosquatting, homograph attacks, URL obfuscation, brand impersonation, and suspicious domain patterns — using a multi-technique heuristic detection engine with per-flag educational explanations.

# 📖 Overview

Cybercriminals craft deceptive URLs to lure users into phishing websites, malware downloads, and credential theft — often making URLs appear legitimate at a glance.

This scanner evaluates URLs across 11 detection techniques, generates a 0–100 risk score, and explains every flagged issue in plain language — teaching users not just *what* is suspicious, but *why* and *how* attackers exploit it.

# ✨ Features

### 🔎 Multi-Technique URL Analysis

| Detection Technique | What It Catches |
|--------------------|----------------|
| Suspicious TLDs | `.xyz`, `.tk`, `.pw`, `.top` and other high-abuse extensions |
| Typosquatting | Misspelled brand names (Levenshtein distance matching) |
| Brand Impersonation | Legitimate brand names embedded in subdomains or paths |
| Homograph Attacks | Lookalike Unicode characters mimicking trusted domains |
| Excessive Subdomains | Deep subdomain chains used to obscure the real domain |
| URL Encoding Abuse | Percent-encoded characters hiding malicious content |
| Suspicious Keywords | `login`, `verify`, `secure`, `account`, `update`, `banking` etc. |
| IP Address URLs | Direct IP hostnames instead of domain names |
| Redirect Chains | Embedded redirect URLs concealing final destinations |
| Entropy Analysis | High-entropy / machine-generated random-looking domains |
| Non-Standard Ports | Unusual port numbers associated with malicious services |

### 📊 Risk Scoring Engine

- Risk score from **0–100** with three verdict tiers:
  - ✅ Likely Safe
  - ⚠️ Suspicious
  - 🚨 Dangerous
- Per-detection severity breakdown
- Detailed explanation for every flagged indicator

### 📚 Educational Explanations

Every detection includes:
- Why the pattern was flagged
- How attackers use the technique in real campaigns
- What the user should do or look for

### 🔒 Privacy-First

- Browser-only execution
- No URL logging or storage
- No external API calls
- No data leaves the browser
